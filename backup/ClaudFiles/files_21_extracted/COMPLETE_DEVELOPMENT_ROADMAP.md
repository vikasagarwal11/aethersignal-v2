## 📋 **CURRENT FOCUS: TRACK 1**

### **What we're building NOW:**

**Traditional PV Platform Features:**
- ✅ File upload (any format)
- ✅ AI extraction (Claude-powered)
- ✅ Statistical signal detection (PRR/ROR/IC)
- ✅ Natural language queries
- ✅ Session management
- 🔄 Chat interface
- 🔄 Multi-file upload
- ⏳ FAERS integration
- ⏳ Quantum enhancement
- ⏳ Complete workflow

**Target market:** Small/mid-size biotechs
**Pricing:** $99/case processed + $999/month SaaS
**Competition:** Oracle Argus, Veeva Safety, ArisGlobal
**Advantage:** AI-first, modern UX, quantum-enhanced

---

## 🎯 **FUTURE VISION: TRACK 2**

### **What we'll build LATER:**

**Digital Twin Platform Features:**
- Patient-centric data model (vs case-centric)
- Longitudinal safety profiles (15-year LTFU)
- Chain of custody integration
- Predictive risk (vs retrospective detection)
- Manufacturing quality linkage
- Patient engagement apps
- Hospital EHR integration (FHIR)
- Blockchain audit trail

**Target market:** Gene/Cell therapy companies
**Pricing:** $$$$ (premium, specialized)
**Competition:** NONE (first-mover advantage)
**Advantage:** Truly revolutionary, no competitors

## 💡 **WHY TWO TRACKS?**

### **Track 1 (Traditional) - WHY NOW:**
1. ✅ Faster to market (12 weeks vs 40+ weeks)
2. ✅ Proven business model
3. ✅ Generate revenue quickly
4. ✅ Learn from real users
5. ✅ Build customer base
6. ✅ Fund Track 2 development

### **Track 2 (Digital Twin) - WHY LATER:**
1. ⚠️ Much more complex (12+ months)
2. ⚠️ Requires new expertise (blockchain, FHIR)
3. ⚠️ Higher development costs
4. ⚠️ Longer sales cycles
5. ⚠️ Regulatory unknowns
6. ✅ But: HUGE moat, revolutionary, no competition
