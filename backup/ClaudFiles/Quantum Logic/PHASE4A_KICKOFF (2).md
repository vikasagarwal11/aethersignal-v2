## ⏳ **What We Need From You:**

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Must Have):**

**1. Quantum Scoring Formula**
```
What: Your composite scoring algorithm
Where: quantum_signal_ranker.py in your Streamlit app
Need: 
- Component names
- Weight values
- Calculation methods
- Normalization
```

**2. Drug Class Mappings**
```
What: Drug class → drug name mappings
Example: 
  'anticoagulants' → [warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, ...]
  'antihypertensives' → [lisinopril, metoprolol, ...]
```

**3. Event Synonym Mappings**
```
What: Event → synonym mappings
Example:
  'bleeding' → [hemorrhage, haemorrhage, epistaxis, ...]
  'cardiac arrest' → [heart attack, MI, cardiac event, ...]
```

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important):**

**4. Multi-Source Corroboration**
```
What: How you combine FAERS + Social + Literature
Need:
- Source priority rankings
- Confidence calculation
- Threshold values
```

**5. NLP Query Parsing**
```
What: How you parse natural language queries
Need:
- Entity extraction methods
- Parsing rules
- Example queries → parsed output
```

### **LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have):**

**6. Social Signal Calculation**
**7. Network Influence (eigenvector centrality)**
**8. Anomaly Detection (LOF/Isolation Forest)**

---

## 💡 **THREE WAYS TO SHARE**

### **Option 1: Share Streamlit Files**
Upload your key Python files:
- quantum_signal_ranker.py
- drug_mappings.py
- event_mappings.py
- multi_source_corroboration.py
- nlp_query_interpreter.py
- social_ae_explorer.py

**I'll extract what I need!**

---

### **Option 2: Copy-Paste Key Snippets**
Just copy relevant code:

```python
# My quantum scoring formula
def calculate_quantum_score(components):
    score = (
        0.30 * components['disproportionality'] +
        0.25 * components['temporal'] +
        0.20 * components['network'] +
        0.15 * components['social'] +
        0.10 * components['anomaly']
    )
    return normalize(score)

# My drug mappings
DRUG_CLASSES = {
    'anticoagulants': ['warfarin', 'apixaban', ...],
    ...
}
```

---

### **Option 3: Describe How It Works**
If you don't have the code, just describe it:

```
"My quantum score has 5 components:
1. Disproportionality (30% weight) - average of PRR, ROR, EBGM normalized to 0-1
2. Temporal (25% weight) - days since first report with exponential decay
3. Network (20% weight) - eigenvector centrality in drug-event network
4. Social (15% weight) - count of social mentions normalized by max
5. Anomaly (10% weight) - z-score of observed/expected ratio

Final score = sum of weighted components"
```

**I can implement from this!**
